      <h3>I. Course Guide</h3>
      <p>At present, there are plethora of high-tech technologies along with software accessible which outline the certain way we all lead our lives. In your career as future technology pacesetter, you are likely to deal with much bigger and more complex computing systems. In view of that, we have to start somewhere, so in this module we will look at the big picture. This course Applications Development and Emerging Technologies focuses on the development of applications using web, mobile, and emerging technologies with emphasis on requirements management, interface design, usability, testing, deployment, including ethical and legal considerations.</p>

      <ol>
      <li>develop specifications for a software development effort that precisely articulate the functional requirements, and the explicit use of cutting edge or emerging technologies;</li>
      <li>select and use a defined coding, documentation writing, and licensing standards where coding idioms and mechanism for implementing designs to achieve desired properties such as reliability, efficiency, and robustness are practiced with respect to legal and ethical considerations; and</li>
      <li>undertake an inspection of the application and testing of the fundamental units of a sufficiently complex software project.
